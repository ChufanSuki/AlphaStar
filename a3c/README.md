### How to initialize weights in PyTorch?

Pass an initialization function to `torch.nn.Module.apply`. It will initialize the weights in the entire `nn.Module` recursively.

Example: 

### Conv2d

Filter in Tensorflow = Kernel in Pytorch.

The number of channels in the output of any layers is equal to the number of filters in that layer.
